      <h4>The Language area of the Montessori classroom encourages development of early-literacy skills through the use of phonetic sounds. In the Language area, children are exposed to various types of phonetic awareness activities to build a strong literary foundation. Montessori Language activities are designed to improve a child's vocabulary, listening skills for common sounds, and differentiating between objects and pictures. Language activities include learning the shapes and sounds of letters, practicing fine motor skills by writing, vocabulary development, matching words and pictures, reading development with word lists, practicing parts of grammar, and creating sentences which will lead to reading.
