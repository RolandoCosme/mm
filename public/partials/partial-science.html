      <h4>Children are natural observers. They are fascinated by the phenomenon found in the natural world. The idea is to introduce children to many things and for them to be able to explore the world around them. Science is everywhere and the sooner you can help your kids develop a love for science, the better. Science in MontessoriÂ is known for introducing children to advanced topics in the early years, preparing them for a lifetime of discovery. Topics range from understanding the difference between a living and nonliving things, basic principles of astronomy, botany, chemistry, physics, and zoology.
